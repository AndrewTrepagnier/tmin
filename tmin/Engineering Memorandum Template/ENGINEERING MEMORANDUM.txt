ENGINEERING MEMORANDUM


[Site Name] - [Fixed Equipment Department] - Fixed Equipment - [Unit]

Repair Plan: [Company] [Pipe Circuit no.] [Size] [Circuit Fluid Service] [Type of Equipment(pipe, vessel, nozzle, tank)] [subcomponent]

Unit: [Unit]

From: [Author Name] ([Author Phone Number])


Date: [Date of generation]



Background:

 - A [Inspection type] inspection driven by equipment strategy of [Type of Equipment(pipe, vessel, nozzle, tank)] found a low remaining wall thickness ([TML number] at [Current thickness to date]") located near on [size] [subcomponent] due to [Internal/External] [EDD] corrosion. 

 - Per Credo, the POF is currently a [current POF] and will progress to a [POF at outage timestamp] through [Unit] [Incoming Outage timestamp] outage opportunity. 

 - [Pipe Circuit No.][Type of component] has a SHE-[SHE consequence level] of a [failure types(pinhole, rupture, corrosion hole)] leading to a potential [Consequence type(Fire scenario, toxic release, burn scenario)]. 

 -AR/T = 1 in [Date AR/T = 1 (formatted as DD-MMM-YYYY)].




Component: [Size] [Circuit Fluid Service] [Type of Equipment(pipe, vessel, nozzle, tank)] [subcomponent]

Design Pressure / Design Temperature: [Design Pressure] PSIG / [Design Temperature] F

Nominal Thickness: [Nominal Thickness]"

Lowest Thickness recorded to date: [current thickness]"

Current Tmin on record: [Current tmin]"




Engineering Recommendation:

Engineering recommendation is to replace the [subcomponent] of the [size][Type of equipment] either prior or during the [Unit] [Incoming Outage timestamp] outage opportunity.

Engineering recommendation is to apply engineered wrap to the [subcomponent] of the [size][Type of equipment] to extend equipment service life to [Unit] [Incoming Outage timestamp] for proper replacement/repair. 

Engineering recommendation is to apply engineered clamp to the [subcomponent] of the [size][Type of equipment] to extend equipment service life to [Unit] [Incoming Outage timestamp] for proper replacement/repair. 


Engineering recommendation is to apply full encirclement welded sleeve to the [subcomponent] of the [size][Type of equipment] to extend equipment service life to [Unit] [Incoming Outage timestamp] for proper replacement/repair. 

Engineering recommendation is to apply welded enclosure to the [subcomponent] of the [size][Type of equipment] to extend equipment service life to [Unit] [Incoming Outage timestamp] for proper replacement/repair.
