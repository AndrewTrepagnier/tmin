TMIN (an abbreviation for "minimum thickness") is an open source python package designed to help engineers determine if corroded process piping in refineries and pertrochemical plants are **safe** and **API-compliant** â€” in seconds.

Many oil and gas companies are faced with maintaining thousands of miles of 100+ year old piping networks supporting multi-million dollar/year processing operations. There is rarely a simple solution to immediately shutdown a process pipe - as these shutdowns more often than not impact other units and cost companies millions in time and resources.

***TMIN can be used as a conservative and rapid engineering support tool for assessing piping inspection data and determine how close the pipe is to its end of service life.***

# How to install and get started

### Installation:

```bash
pip install tmin
```

### Basic Example:

Suppose the following scenario:

  <img width="400" height="800" alt="46743011_2274515489447710_6925256605814489088_n" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f2161758-9138-4232-956b-29e3a1d308ad"/>


RT Inspection findings show your 3/4" S/160 pipe has 0.092" (or 2.36 mm) wall thickness. When it was first installed in 2012, it had a nominal thickness of 0.219", indicating that it has corroded 0.126" (or 126 Mils) in 13 years.

You need to know if the pipe can safely remain in service until TA 2027 when it can be replaced.

TMIN will preform calculations, create visuals, and generate a full assessment report - with only three python functions.



**Results:** Professional report with compliance status, remaining life, and visual analysis in under 30 seconds.




## Why TMIN

## Command Line Interface

**Basic Analysis**
```bash
tmin -s 40 -n "2" -p 50 -c 150 -m "Intermediate/Low CS" -a 23333 -t 0.060
```

**With Corrosion Rate**
```bash
tmin -s 40 -n "2" -p 50 -c 150 -m "Intermediate/Low CS" -a 23333 -t 0.060 -r 10 -y 2023
```

**Using Configuration File**
```bash
# Create pipe_config.toml with your parameters
tmin -f pipe_config.toml -t 0.060
```

**Custom Output Directory**
```bash
tmin -s 40 -n "2" -p 50 -c 150 -m "Intermediate/Low CS" -a 23333 -t 0.060 -o ./my_reports
```
